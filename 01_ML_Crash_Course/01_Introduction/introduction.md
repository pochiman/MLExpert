foundational knowledge you need to ace any machine-learning interview and land a 
job in the industry. Let's get to work!

# Key Terms

# [Ranking]
Optimizing machine learning models to rank candidates, such as music, articles, or 
products. Typically, the goal is to order the candidates such that the candidates 
which are most likely to be interacted with (purchased, viewed, liked, etc.) are 
above other candidates that aren't as likely to be interacted with.

# [Supervised_Learning]
Optimizing machine learning models based on previously observed features and labels. 
Typically, the goal is to attach the most likely label to some provided features.

# [Unsupervised_Learning]
An approach within machine learning that takes in unlabeled examples and produces 
patterns from the provided data. Typically, the goal is to discover something 
previously unknown about the unlabeled examples.

# [Deep_Learning]
Optimizing neural networks, often with many hidden layers, to perform unsupervised 
or supervised learning.

# [Recommendation_Systems]
Systems with the goal of presenting an item to a user such that the user will most 
likely purchase, view, or like the recommended item. Items can take many forms, 
such as music, movies, or products. Also called recommender systems.
