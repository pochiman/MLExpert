# 3 - Naive Bayes

In the real world, naive baes are young, inexperienced lovers.

In the machine-learning world, naive bayes are probabilistic classification 
algorithms based on Baye's theorem.

# Prerequisites

# [Supervised_Learning]
Optimized machine learning mdoels based on previously observed features and labels. 
Typically, the goal is to attach the most likely label to some provided features.

# Key Terms

# [Model]
An approximation of a relationship between an input and an output.

# [Heuristic]
An approach to finding a solution which is typically faster but less accurate than 
some optimal solution.

# [Bernoulli_Distribution] π
A distribution which evaluates a particular outcome as binary. In the Bernoulli 
Naive Bayes classifier case, a word was either in a message or not in a message, 
which is a binary representation.

# [Prior] π
Indicates the probability of a particular class regardless of the features of some 
example.

# [Likelihood] π
The probability of some features given a particular class.

# [Evidence] π
The denominator of the Naive Bayes classifier.

# [Posterior] π
The probability of a class given some features.

# [Vocabulary]
The list of words that the Naive Bayes classifier recognizes.

# [Laplace_Smoothing] π
A type of additive smoothing which mitigates the chance of encountering zero 
probabilities within the Naive Bayes classifier.

# [Tokenization]
The splitting of some raw textual input into individual words or elements.

# [Featurization]
The process of transforming raw inputs into something a model can perform training 
and predictions on.

# [Vectorizer]
Used in a step of featurizing. It transforms some input into something else. One 
example is a binary vectorizer which transforms tokenized messages into a binary 
vector indicating which items in the vocabulary appear in the message.

# [Stop_Word]
A word, typically discarded, which doesn't add much predictive value.

# [Stemming]
Removing the ending modifiers of words, leaving the step of the word.

# [Lemmatization]
A more calculated form of stemming which ensures the proper lemma results from 
removing the word modifiers.
