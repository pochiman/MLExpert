# Recommender Systems

# 17 - Collaborative and Content Based Filtering

Teamwork makes the dream work!

A timeless adage that applies to every aspect of life, be it sports, academia, 
relationships, and yes, even machine-learning systems.

# Key Terms

# [Content_Filtering]
A recommendation technique which takes into account a single user's features and 
many items' features.
    
# [Collaborative_Filtering]
A recommendation technique which uses many user's and item's data typically in 
the form of a user-item matrix.
    
# [User-item_Matrix]
A matrix which contains the interactions of users and items. Items can take the 
form of products, music, and videos.
    
# [Pearson_Correlation] Ï€
A measure of the correlation between two inputs. In the context of recommendation 
systems. Pearson correlation can be used to construct an item-item similarity 
matrix.
    
# [Time_Decay]
The added modelling assumption that interactions between items and users should 
count for less over time.
    
# [Inverse_User_Frequency]
The added modelling assumption that if a user interacts with a less overall popular 
item, then the interaction should count for more. 
    
# [Matrix_Factorization]
Factors the user-item matrix into embeddings such that multiplying together the 
resulting embedding layers gives an estimate for the original user-item matrix.

# [Implicit_Rating]
A rating obtained from user behavior as opposed to surveying the user.
    
# [SparkML]
Refers to APIs which provide machine learning capabilities on Spark dataframes.
    
# [Cold-start]
A challenge with recommendation systems in which users or items are new and that 
there is limited or no information in terms of the user-item matrix. This can make personalized recommendations difficult or impossible.
    
# [Echo_Chamber]
A state of a recommendation system in which user behavior is reinforced by the 
recommendations themselves.
    
# [Shilling_Attack]
A type of attack on a recommendation system in which users manipulate the recommendations 
by inflating or deflating positive interactions for their own or competing items.
