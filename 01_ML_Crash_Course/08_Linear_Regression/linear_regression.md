# 8 - Linear Regression

You know that topic the professor spent half the semester talking about in your 
intro college stats class, but that you never really paid attention to? Yes, you 
know the one. 

Well, friend, it's time to make it your best friend, because it certainly is a 
good friend of our machine (overlords) friends.

# Key Terms

# [Line_of_Best_Fit]
The line through data points which best describe the relationship of a dependent 
variable with one or more independent variables. Ordinary least squares can be 
used to find the line of best fit.
    
# [P-value] π
The probability of finding a particular result, or a greater result, given a null 
hypothesis being true.

# [Confidence_Interval] π
The possible range of an unknown value. Often comes with some degree of probability 
e.g. 95% confidence interval.

# [Correlation] π
The relationship between a dependent and independent variable.

# [R-squared] π
Also the coefficient of determination, the percent of variance in the dependent 
variable explained by the independent variable(s).

# [Residuals]
The distance between points and a particular line.

# [Independent_Variable]
A variable whose variation is independent from other variables.    

# [One-hot_Encoding]
An encoding for categorical variables where every value that a variable can take 
on is represented as a binary vector.

# [Dependent_Variable]
A variable whose variation depends on other variables.

# [Variance_Inflation_Factor] π
A measure of multicollinearity in a regression model.

# [Collinearity] π
When one or more (multicollinearity) independent variables are not actually 
independent.    

# [Feature_Interaction]
Features that are multiplied by one another in order to express relationships 
that can't be represented by adding the independent variable terms together.

# [Nonlinear_Regression]
A type of regression which models nonlinear relationships in the independent 
variables.    

# [Simpson's_Paradox]
When a pattern emerges in segments of examples but is no longer present when the 
segments are grouped together.

# [statsmodels] ϟ
Python module which provides various statistical tools.

# [Coefficient] π
Another name for a parameter in the regression model.
