# Unsupervised Learning

# 11 - K-means

Centroid. Metroid. Medoid.

Two of these refer to a cluster's center in the context of clustering algorithms. 
The other refers to a parasitic, life-draining alien jellyfish.

Can you guess which is which?

# Prerequisites

# [Unsupervised_Learning]
An approach within machine learning that takes in unlabeled examples and produces 
patterns from the provided data. Typically, the goal is to discover something 
previously unknown about the unlabeled examples.

# Key Terms

# [Centroid]
The location of the center of a cluster in n-dimensions.

# [Inertia]
The sum of distances between each point and the centroid.

# [Local_Optima] π
A maxima or minima which is not the global optima.    

# [Non-convex_Function] π
A function which has two or more instances of zero-slope.

# [Elbow_Method]
A method of finding the best value for k in k-means. It involves finding the 
elbow of the plot of a range of ks and their respective inertias.

# [Silhouette_Method]
A method of finding the best value for k in k-means. It takes into account the 
ratios of the inter and intra clusters distances.

# [K-means++]
Using a weighted probability distribution as a way to find the initial centroid 
locations for the k-means algorithm.

# [Agglomerative_Clustering]
A clustering algorithm that builds a hierarchy of subclusters that gradually group 
into a single cluster. Some techniques for measuring distances between clusters are single-linkage and complete-linkage methods.
