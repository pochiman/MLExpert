# 6 - K Nearest Neighbors

"You are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with." 

While this statement might sound a bit reductive, if not slightly offensive, the 
truth is that, in practice, proximity does in fact often entail similarity, as Ryan 
will demonstrate in this video.

# Prerequisites

# [TF-IDF]
Short for `Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency`, TF-IDF is a method of 
transforming features, usually representing counts of words, into values representing 
the overall importance of different words across some documents.

# Key Terms

# [Cluster]
A consolidated group of points.

# [Euclidean_Distance] π
The length of the line between two points.

# [Feature_Normalization]
Typically referring to feature scaling that places the values of a feature between 
0 and 1.

# [Feature_Standardization]
Typically referring to feature scaling that centers the values of a feature around 
the mean of the feature and scales by the standard deviation of the feature.

# [Jaccard_Distance] π
One minus the ratio of the number of like binary feature values and the number of 
like and unlike binary feature values, excluding instances of matching zeros.

# [Simple_Matching_Distance] π
One minus the ratio of the number of like binary feature values and the number of 
like and unlike binary feature values.

# [Manhattan_Distance] π
Sum of the absolute differences of two input features.

# [Hamming_Distance] π
The sum of the non-matching categorical feature values.
