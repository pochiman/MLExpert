# 5 - Naive Bayes Optimizations
Another section on Naive Bayes? 

Yes! As it turns out, there is more to this model than meets the eye. So stick 
around, and you'll see why it isn't as naive as it might have originally seemed.

# Key Terms

# [Multinomial_Distribution] π
A distribution which models the probability of counts of particular outcomes.

# [TF-IDF]
Short for `Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency`, TF-IDF is a method of 
transforming features, usually representing counts of words, into values 
representing the overall importance of different words across some documents.

# [Online_Learning]
Incremental learning within a model to represent an incrementally changing 
population.

# [N-gram]
A series of adjacent words of length n.

# [Feature_Hashing]
Representing feature inputs, such as articles or messages, as the result of hashes 
modded by predetermined value.

# [scikit-learn]
A machine learning python library which provides implementations of regression, 
classification, and clustering.

# [Kernel_Density_Estimation] π
Also KDE, a way to estimate the probability distribution of some data.
