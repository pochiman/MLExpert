# Design YouTube's Recommendation System

Design a system to recommend YouTube videos to users.

Many systems design questions are intentionally left very vague and are literally given in the form of `Design Foobar`. It's your job to ask clarifying questions to better understand the system that you have to build.

We've laid out some of these questions below; their answers should give you some guidance on the problem. Before looking at them, we encourage you to take few minutes to think about what questions you'd ask in a real interview.

# Clarifying Questions To Ask

# [Question_1]
Q: Do we have to design YouTube's user interface?

A: No, you can assume that the interface is already designed. Your system should simply provide videos to display as recommendations on the home page.

# [Question_2]
Q: Do we have to design a way to train the model that we'll use?

A: Yes, you should detail how the model that you'll use will be trained.

# [Question_3]
Q: Do we have to design a way for scientists and ML engineers to do model development?

A: No, that's out of the scope of this question.

# [Question_4]
Q: Do we need to design the way that our model will be hosted for real-time users?

A: Yes, you'll need to cover how live users will receive recommendations from your model.

# [Question_5]
Q: Do we need to have our system perform online evaluations such as A/B tests?

A: No, we're only concerned with designing a modelâ€”not measuring the model's performance against an existing model.

# [Question_6]
Q: Do we need to design a data pipeline that transforms raw data into features and labels?

A: No, that system will be provided for you.

# [Question_7]
Q: Do we have to support model retraining or online learning?

A: No, you can assume that the model doesn't need retraining or online learning.

# [Question_8]
Q: Can we assume that we have access to a cloud-compute-infrastructure platform such as Google Cloud Platform?

A: Yes, that's fine to use here.
