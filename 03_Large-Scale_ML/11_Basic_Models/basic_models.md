# 11 - Basic Models

In the Machine Learning Crash Course, we looked at a number of basic machine-learning 
models you can use, but we did so from a simplified, theoretical point of view.

It's time to revisit some of these models and explore how we can alter them to work 
in a large, enterprise-level data setting.

# Key Term
