# 7 - Frequentist AB Testing

A: Here, we'll introduce A/B testing—from the frequently used frequentist 
perspective.

B: Here, we'll cover frequentist A/B testing—don't tell the Bayesians!

# Key Terms

# [A/B_Testing]

  The process of providing two or more different experiences across two or more
  subgroups of a population. The goal is to measure the change in behavior of
  the subgroups upon receiving the respective experiences.

# [A/A_Test]

  An A/B test in which the experiences being tested are identical to one
  another. This is done in an effort to determine statistical validity of the
  A/B tool, the metric being monitored, and the analysis process being used.

# [User_Agent]
An identifier used to describe the software application which a user is using to 
interact with another software application. For instance, an HTTP request to a 
website typically includes the user agent so that the website knows how to render 
the webpage.

# [Session_ID]
A unique identifier assigned to a user to keep track of a user's connected 
interactions. For instance, a session may include a user logging in, purchasing 
an item, and logging out. Here, the session ID would be used to reference the 
group of those three interactions. This session ID can be stored in the user's 
internet browser as a cookie.

# [Cookie]
A small piece of data stored by a browser which indicates stateful information 
for a particular website. For instance, a cookie can be stored in your browser 
after you log in to a website to indicate that you are logged in. This will stop 
subsequent pages from asking you to log in again.
